<h1>machine learning</h1>
<p>I am interested in using Machine Learning for social good. More specifically I like doing research in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I&rsquo;m also interested in exploring questions surrounding the ethics of, and accesibility in AI in more depth.</p>

<p><strong>Machine Learning assisted evolutionary optimization</strong> (with <a href="https://www.iitr.ac.in/~ME/Dhish" target="_blank">Prof. Dhish Kumar Saxena</a>

, IIT Roorkee)</p>
<p>Multi-objective optimization involves optimizing multiple conflicting objectives simultaneously. Minimizing cost and fuel consumption, and maximizing user comfort of a vehicle is an example of such problems. Evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms effectively handle such problems, by iteratively aiming to achieve a well-converged and well-diverse set of Pareto-optimal solutions.
  Much research has been performed on the former. We analyse the suitability of machine learning algorithms to generate new solutions that are potentially more converged and/or more diverse. \\ In this project, we aim to investigate the dataset features and choose a suitable ML model for this task, followed by an experimental investigation. We aim to isolate the parameters used by these optimizers and design a suitable adaptation function to adapt them on the fly, removing any prior fixations.
  Our work was accepted in EMO 2023, held in Leiden, Netherlands. </p>

<p><strong>FaIRCoP: Facial Image Retrieval using Contrastive Personalization</strong>(with <a href="https://midas.iiitd.edu.in/team/rajiv-ratn-shah.html" target="_blank">Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah</a>

  ,MIDAS Labs, IIIT Delhi)</p>
<p>Worked on Facial Image Retrieval for suspect identification. We proposed a relevance feedback method that utlizes the user's binary feedback to exploit the contrastive learning paradigm for encapsulating each user's personalized notion of similarity. For this, we worked on a novel loss function, optimized online via user feedback and a corresponding scoring function for inference. We also design a testbed to utilize simulated user feedback and automate the comparison of different relevance feedback mechanisms and other design choices.</p>
<p> Our work was accepted in the student abstract track of AAAI 2022 and WACV 2023</p>

<p><strong>Making Discriminative Natural Language Infilling more robust</strong>(with <a href="https://sporia.info/" target="_blank">Prof. Soujanya Poria</a>

  ,Declare Lab, Singapore University of Technology and Design)</p>
<p>The main task is to generate semantically similar correct and incorrect options for masked sentences within common-sense stories and natural dialogue datasets and to make it as hard as possible for state-of-the-art NLP models to differentiate between the correct and incorrect options</p>

<p><strong>Covid cases predictor and NPI prescriptor</strong>(with <a href="http://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/debasish-ghose/" target="_blank">Prof. Debasish Ghose</a>

    ,IISc Bangalore)</p>
<p>Built a Covid cases predictor using LSTMs and an NPI prescriptor model using an encoder-decoder architecture. Ranked among 48 finalists from 17 countries in the Global Pandemic Response Challenge, was a member of India's only qualifying team.</p>
